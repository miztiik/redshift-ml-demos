# Airflow Demo

Can you help help the engineers at Mystique Unicorn to deploy a churn prediction model in Redshift using the new Redshift ML feature<sup>[1]</sup>?

## üéØ Solutions

1. Create a Multi-AZ VPC with NAT Gateway
1. Create Redshift cluster environment will be configured to have a public endpoint and secrets stored in secrets manager<sup>[2]</sup>
1. Connect to the cluster using query editor in redshift console
1. Let us do the `churn prediction` example shown in this doc<sup>[3]</sup>
1. Check model state,

```sql
select schema_name, model_name, model_state from stv_ml_model_info;

 schema_name |        model_name         |  model_state
-------------+---------------------------+----------------
 public      | customer_churn_auto_model | Model is Ready

```
1. Predict proportion of churners and non-churners among customers from different states from `2020-01-01`

```sql
WITH inferred AS (SELECT state,
       customer_churn_auto_model( 
          state,
          account_length,
          area_code, 
          total_charge/account_length, 
          cust_serv_calls/account_length )::varchar(6)
          AS active FROM customer_activity
          WHERE record_date > '2020-01-01' )
SELECT state, SUM(CASE WHEN active = 'True.' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churners,
       SUM(CASE WHEN active = 'False.' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nonchurners,
       COUNT(*) AS total_per_state
FROM inferred
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY state;
```


## üìå Who is using this

This repository aims to show how to Redshift ML to new developers, Solution Architects & Ops Engineers in AWS. Based on that knowledge these Udemy [course #1][102], [course #2][101] helps you build complete architecture in AWS.
